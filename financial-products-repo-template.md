## What This Is

[Product Name] is part of an open-source initiative to help financial institutions navigate the emerging risks of agentic AI systems. As banks and fintech companies rapidly adopt AI agents for everything from customer service to trading, we're seeing new types of risks that traditional security tools weren't designed to handle.

## The Current Landscape

Right now, we're at an inflection point. Financial institutions are deploying AI agents across critical functions - processing payments, managing customer interactions, making trading decisions, and automating operations. But here's the thing: these AI systems can act autonomously, making decisions and taking actions without human approval for each step.

This creates a whole new category of risks:
- AI agents can make mistakes at scale (one misconfiguration affects thousands of transactions)
- Traditional security tools don't understand AI agent behavior
- Regulatory bodies are starting to ask questions, but there aren't clear frameworks yet
- The industry is moving fast, but the safety infrastructure is lagging behind

## Why We Built This

We built [Product Name] because we saw a gap. The financial services industry needs tools that understand AI agents - how they work, how they can fail, and how to keep them safe. Rather than keeping this knowledge proprietary, we're open-sourcing it so the entire industry can benefit.

Our hope is that by making these tools public:
1. **More people can contribute** - Security is better when it's collaborative
2. **Smaller institutions can benefit** - Not everyone has massive security budgets
3. **The industry learns together** - We can share knowledge and improve faster
4. **Transparency builds trust** - Financial systems need to be trustworthy

## What [Product Name] Does

[Brief, informal description of what the product does - 2-3 paragraphs in plain language]

## Who This Is For

This is for anyone working with AI agents in financial services:
- Developers building AI-powered features
- Security teams trying to understand new risks
- Compliance teams preparing for regulatory questions
- Risk managers evaluating AI deployments
- Anyone curious about how to make AI systems safer in finance

## Current Status

This is an open-source project in active development. We're building this in public because we believe the financial industry needs better tools for AI agent security, and we want to collaborate with the community.
