## Quick Start

Each product is a standalone project with:
- ✅ README with setup instructions
- ✅ Requirements/dependencies file
- ✅ Working code
- ✅ Configuration examples
- ✅ .gitignore file

## Distribution Strategy

These products succeed through distribution, not technical complexity:

1. **Product Hunt launches** - All products are launch-ready
2. **Niche communities** - Each targets specific communities
3. **Clear value props** - Simple, understandable benefits
4. **Low barrier to entry** - Easy to set up and use
5. **Viral potential** - Built-in sharing mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. Test each product locally
2. Set up API keys and configurations
3. Create GitHub repositories for each
4. Write launch content for Product Hunt
5. Share in relevant communities

## Notes

- All products use Python except #2 (Chrome extension - JavaScript)
- Most require API keys (see individual READMEs)
- All include error handling and basic documentation
- Products are production-ready but may need polish for scale
