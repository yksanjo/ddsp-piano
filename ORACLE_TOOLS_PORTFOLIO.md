# Run the script
chmod +x create_oracle_tools_repos.sh
./create_oracle_tools_repos.sh
```

### 2. Manual GitHub Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# For each repo
cd oracle-license-optimizer
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
gh repo create oracle-license-optimizer --public --source=. --push
```

### 3. Add to Each Repo

Each repo should have:
- ✅ README.md (with acquisition strategy)
- ✅ LICENSE (Apache 2.0)
- ✅ requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
- ✅ Dockerfile (for easy deployment)
- ✅ .gitignore
- ⏳ Basic code structure (to be added)

## 💰 Acquisition Valuation Model

### Factors Oracle Considers:
1. **Customer Base**: Oracle customers using tools
2. **Revenue**: ARR, growth rate
3. **Technology**: Unique capabilities Oracle needs
4. **Team**: Engineering talent
5. **Market Position**: Market share, brand

### Valuation Formula:
```
Acquisition Value = 
  (ARR × 5-10x multiple) +
  (Customer Base × $50K-$200K per customer) +
  (Technology Value × $5M-$20M) +
  (Team Value × $1M-$5M per engineer)
```

### Example Scenario:
- **5 tools** with 100 enterprise customers each = 500 customers
- **ARR**: $20M (average $40K per customer)
- **Team**: 20 engineers
- **Technology**: Unique Oracle optimization capabilities

**Valuation:**
- ARR multiple: $20M × 7x = $140M
- Customer value: 500 × $100K = $50M
- Technology: $10M
- Team: 20 × $2M = $40M
- **Total: $240M**
