### 4. Quantum Coin Demo
```
🪙 Demo 1: Quantum Coin

Classical coin = heads OR tails
Quantum coin = heads AND tails (until measured!)

See superposition in action:

### 5. Quantum Twins (Entanglement)
```
🔗 Demo 2: Quantum Twins

Two qubits, instant correlation - even 100km apart!

Measure one, the other instantly knows. Quantum non-locality is real!
