## Executive Summary

As Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), your institutions are at the forefront of deploying agentic AI systems across critical functions: trading, payments, customer service, risk management, and operations. However, the rapid adoption of autonomous AI agents introduces unprecedented systemic risks that traditional security and governance frameworks were not designed to address.

**The 2026 Horizon**: Industry reports and regulatory bodies (OCC, FCA, ECB) anticipate a rapid move to agentic AI in 2025–2026. This combination of faster adoption + novel risks makes financial disruption credible within this timeframe.

**The Solution**: A comprehensive, enterprise-ready security suite purpose-built for G-SIBs—10 integrated products that provide complete visibility, control, and compliance for your AI agent workforce.

## The Risk Landscape: Why G-SIBs Are Most Vulnerable

### 1. Payment Rails & Cross-Border Settlement
**Your Challenge**: JPMorgan processes $6+ trillion in daily payments. Morgan Stanley handles billions in cross-border transactions. Real-time payment systems (FedNow, SWIFT) are being reworked with AI for routing, FX, and reconciliation.

**The Risk**: One misconfigured AI agent can cause immediate systemic effects—payment delays, settlement failures, or liquidity stress across correspondent networks.

**Our Solution**: **PaymentSentinel** (Product 3) provides real-time transaction defense, intercepting and validating every AI agent-initiated payment before it propagates through payment rails.

### 2. Legacy Core Banking Platforms
**Your Challenge**: Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo still run critical functions on legacy cores (FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry) from the 1980s-1990s. These systems weren't designed for AI agents.

**The Risk**: Agentic automation writing or patching code against legacy cores can introduce bugs or break integrations at scale. Data corruption recovery averages $8M+ and takes weeks.

**Our Solution**: **LegacyBridge AI Gateway** (Product 4) provides a secure integration layer, enabling AI innovation while protecting legacy cores from corruption and system instability.

### 3. Software Supply Chain & CI/CD Pipelines
**Your Challenge**: Your development teams are adopting AI coding tools (GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer) to accelerate digital transformation. JPMorgan alone has thousands of developers.

**The Risk**: AI coding agents can introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious code suggestions. Supply chain attacks average $11M+ in impact.

**Our Solution**: **CodeShield AI** (Product 2) and **SupplyChainGuard** (Product 9) protect your entire development pipeline, validating AI-generated code before it reaches production.

### 4. Trading, Treasury & Settlement Systems
**Your Challenge**: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan use algorithmic trading and automated treasury management. High-frequency decisioning driven by AI agents creates rapid cascades.

**The Risk**: Model misbehavior or manipulation can cause rapid cascades of bad trades or settlement failures. A single incident can cost tens of millions.

**Our Solution**: **ModelWatch** (Product 5) and **FleetCommand** (Product 6) provide continuous model validation and multi-agent coordination, preventing cascading failures.

### 5. Customer-Facing AI Agents
**Your Challenge**: All major banks are piloting AI agents for customer service, budgeting, and payment instructions. Bank of America's Erica, Citi's chatbot, JPMorgan's virtual assistants.

**The Risk**: Prompt injection attacks can hijack agents, causing account takeovers, unauthorized transactions, or data breaches. Fraud losses average $1.2M+ annually per institution.

**Our Solution**: **PromptShield** (Product 7) provides enterprise-grade input validation, preventing prompt injection attacks and account takeovers.
