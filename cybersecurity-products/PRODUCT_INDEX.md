## Product Details

### 1. Autonomous Threat-Hunting AI Agent
**File:** [product-1-autonomous-threat-hunter.md](./product-1-autonomous-threat-hunter.md)

**Problem Solved:** Security teams can't manually monitor hundreds of AI agents. Threats are detected too late (hours) and responded to too slowly (days).

**Solution:** Autonomous AI agent that continuously monitors, investigates, and responds to threats 24/7 without human intervention.

**Key Metrics:**
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD): <1 minute (vs. 4-6 hours traditional)
- Mean Time to Response (MTTR): <5 minutes (vs. 3-5 days traditional)
- False Positive Rate: <5% (vs. 60% traditional)
- Threat Detection Rate: >99% (vs. 60% traditional)

**Best For:** Enterprises with large AI agent deployments, SOC teams, security operations centers

### 2. AI Agent WAF (Input Validation & Protection)
**File:** [product-2-ai-agent-waf.md](./product-2-ai-agent-waf.md)

**Problem Solved:** AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, account takeovers, and data exfiltration. Traditional WAFs don't understand AI agent behavior.

**Solution:** Real-time input validation and protection system that analyzes every input to AI agents, blocking malicious prompts and adversarial inputs.

**Key Metrics:**
- Attack Block Rate: >99%
- False Positive Rate: <2%
- Latency: <50ms
- Attack Pattern Database: 10,000+ patterns

**Best For:** Customer-facing AI agents, financial institutions, healthcare organizations, e-commerce platforms

### 3. Cross-Cloud Security Policy Manager
**File:** [product-3-cross-cloud-policy-manager.md](./product-3-cross-cloud-policy-manager.md)

**Problem Solved:** Security policies are fragmented across AWS, Azure, GCP. Policy drift goes undetected. Compliance is complex across multiple clouds.

**Solution:** Unified policy management platform that defines, deploys, and enforces security policies across all clouds and AI agents from one place.

**Key Metrics:**
- Policy Compliance Rate: >99%
- Mean Time to Detect Violations: <1 minute (vs. 2-3 days traditional)
- Policy Violations: 90% reduction
- Multi-Cloud Support: AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes

**Best For:** Multi-cloud enterprises, financial institutions, healthcare organizations, technology companies

---

### 4. Zero-Trust AI Access Layer
**File:** [product-4-zero-trust-ai-access.md](./product-4-zero-trust-ai-access.md)

**Problem Solved:** Traditional zero-trust solutions are designed for human users. Machine identities outnumber human identities 45:1. Context-blind policies don't work for AI agents.

**Solution:** Context-aware authentication and authorization platform that understands AI agent behavior, implements dynamic access control, and scales to millions of machine identities.

**Key Metrics:**
- Machine Identity Scale: Millions of identities
- Authentication Latency: <100ms
- Policy Compliance Rate: >99%
- Identity Rotation: Automated

**Best For:** Enterprises with 100+ AI agents, financial institutions, technology companies, government agencies
