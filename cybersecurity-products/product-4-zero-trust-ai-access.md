# Product 4: Zero-Trust AI Access Layer

## Executive Summary

Zero-Trust AI Access Layer is a context-aware authentication and authorization platform purpose-built for AI agents. Unlike traditional zero-trust solutions designed for human users, this platform understands AI agent behavior patterns, implements dynamic access control based on agent context, and scales to millions of machine identities.

## Product Vision

"Zero-trust security for the AI agent era" - Enable enterprises to implement zero-trust architecture for AI agents with context-aware authentication, dynamic authorization, and continuous verification—scaling to millions of machine identities while maintaining security and performance.

## Problem Statement

Traditional zero-trust solutions fail for AI agents:

**Human-Centric Design**: Traditional zero-trust assumes human users with predictable behavior. AI agents have different patterns.

**Scale Problem**: Machine identities outnumber human identities 45:1. Traditional solutions don't scale.

**Context Blindness**: Traditional zero-trust doesn't understand AI agent context (what agent is doing, why, when).

**Static Policies**: Traditional zero-trust uses static policies. AI agents need dynamic, context-aware policies.

**Performance Impact**: Traditional zero-trust adds latency. AI agents need sub-100ms authentication.

**Real Impact:**
- 73% of enterprises struggle with machine identity management
- Average cost of machine identity breach: $2.4M
- Mean time to detect compromised machine identity: 4-6 hours
- 60% of cloud security incidents involve compromised machine identities
- AI agents create 10x more machine identities than traditional systems

## Target Customer Profile
