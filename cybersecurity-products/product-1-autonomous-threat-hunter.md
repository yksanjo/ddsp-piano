# Product 1: Autonomous Threat-Hunting AI Agent

## Executive Summary

Autonomous Threat-Hunting AI Agent is a self-directed security investigation system that continuously monitors, analyzes, and responds to threats across AI agent deployments. Unlike traditional security tools that require human analysts to investigate alerts, this AI agent operates autonomously—learning normal behavior patterns, detecting anomalies, and taking automated response actions.

## Product Vision

"Autonomous security analyst that never sleeps" - Enable enterprises to detect and respond to AI agent threats 24/7 without human intervention, reducing mean time to detection (MTTD) from hours to seconds and mean time to response (MTTR) from days to minutes.

## Problem Statement

Traditional security tools fail in the AI agent era:

**Alert Fatigue**: Security teams receive thousands of alerts daily, most are false positives. Human analysts can't keep up.
**Slow Response**: Mean time to detect threats: 4-6 hours. Mean time to respond: 3-5 days. AI agents can cause damage in minutes.
**Skill Gap**: Security analysts lack expertise in AI agent behavior patterns. Traditional SIEM rules don't work for AI threats.
**Scale Problem**: Enterprises deploy hundreds of AI agents. Manual monitoring is impossible.
**Context Blindness**: Traditional tools see individual events, not agent behavior patterns over time.

**Real Impact:**
- 99% of security professionals experienced attacks on AI services in the past year
- Breaches occur in as little as 25 minutes
- Average cost of AI agent security incident: $2.4M
- Security teams spend 60% of time on false positives

## Target Customer Profile

**Primary Buyers:**
- Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs)
- Security Operations Center (SOC) Managers
- Threat Intelligence Directors
- Chief Risk Officers (CROs)

**Institution Types:**
- Enterprises with 50+ AI agents deployed
- Financial institutions (G-SIBs, regional banks)
- Healthcare organizations (HIPAA compliance)
- Technology companies (SaaS platforms)
- Government agencies (critical infrastructure)

**Buying Triggers:**
- Scaling AI agent deployments (can't manually monitor)
- Post-incident remediation (missed threat, slow response)
- SOC team burnout (alert fatigue, analyst turnover)
- Regulatory requirements (24/7 monitoring, rapid response)
- Cost reduction initiatives (automate security operations)

## Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. Autonomous Threat Detection Engine

**What it does:**
- Continuously monitors all AI agent activity (API calls, data access, actions taken)
- Learns normal behavior patterns for each agent (baseline establishment)
- Detects anomalies in real-time (deviations from normal patterns)
- Scores threats by severity (0-100 risk scale)
- Correlates events across agents and time (identify coordinated attacks)

**Detection Capabilities:**
- **Behavioral Anomalies**: Unusual API call patterns, data access spikes, action frequency changes
- **Privilege Escalation**: Agents accessing resources beyond normal scope
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unusual data transfer volumes or destinations
- **Model Manipulation**: Changes to agent behavior, prompt injection attempts
- **Coordinated Attacks**: Multiple agents acting in suspicious patterns
- **Zero-Day Threats**: Unknown attack patterns detected via ML models

**Technical Implementation:**
- Real-time stream processing (Apache Flink, Kafka)
- ML models (unsupervised learning, anomaly detection)
- Behavioral baselines (per-agent, per-team, per-organization)
- Event correlation engine (graph-based analysis)

- **Timeline Reconstruction**: Builds chronological view of events
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifies why threat occurred (misconfiguration, attack, bug)
- **Impact Assessment**: Determines scope of threat (which agents, data, systems affected)
- **Threat Attribution**: Identifies attack source (internal, external, specific user)

**Investigation Playbooks:**
- **Account Takeover**: Investigate authentication events, access patterns, user behavior
- **Data Breach**: Analyze data access logs, exfiltration patterns, destination analysis
- **Privilege Escalation**: Review permission changes, access attempts, role modifications
- **Model Poisoning**: Examine training data, model changes, performance degradation

- Learns from responses (improve future actions)

**Response Actions:**
- **Isolate Agent**: Temporarily disable agent, block network access
- **Quarantine Data**: Move data to secure location, prevent access
- **Revoke Credentials**: Disable API keys, tokens, certificates
- **Rollback Changes**: Revert agent actions, restore previous state
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle agent activity, reduce impact
- **Alert Escalation**: Notify security team, create incident ticket

**Response Policies:**
- **Low Risk**: Monitor only, log for analysis
- **Medium Risk**: Rate limit, notify security team
- **High Risk**: Isolate agent, escalate immediately
- **Critical Risk**: Full containment, executive notification

**Technical Implementation:**
