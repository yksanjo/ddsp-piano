⚛️ Just launched 7 interactive quantum computing demos! Perfect for non-experts - no math jargon, just visual learning. 🔗 All open source on GitHub #QuantumComputing #Education #STEM

@OsakaUniv 🎓 Excited to share our quantum demos series! Built for students & educators - each demo runs in 30-60 seconds with clear "wow" moments. Perfect for quantum education! ⚛️ #QuantumEducation

@IBMQuantum @GoogleQuantumAI @AmazonBraket Our demos work with simulators now, but ready to connect to real quantum hardware! 7 demos covering superposition, entanglement, Grover's algorithm & more 🚀

🪙 Demo 1: Quantum Coin. Classical coin = heads OR tails. Quantum coin = heads AND tails (until measured!) See superposition: github.com/yksanjo/quantum-coin-demo ⚛️ #QuantumComputing

🔗 Demo 2: Quantum Twins. Two qubits, instant correlation - even 100km apart! Measure one, the other instantly knows. Quantum non-locality is real! github.com/yksanjo/quantum-twins-demo #Entanglement

🔍 Demo 3: Grover Search. Classical: ~4 attempts. Quantum: ~2 attempts. See quantum speedup in action! github.com/yksanjo/grover-search-demo #QuantumAlgorithms

🎲 Demo 4: Quantum Randomness. True randomness from quantum measurements - not pseudo-random! Used in real security systems. github.com/yksanjo/quantum-randomness-demo #Cryptography

📚 Complete Series: 7 Quantum Demos. ✅ Superposition ✅ Entanglement ✅ Grover Search ✅ Randomness ✅ Teleportation (soon) ✅ Noise comparison ✅ Art generator. All on GitHub: github.com/yksanjo

👨‍🏫 Calling all quantum educators! These demos are perfect for classrooms, science museums, public events & online learning. No math jargon - just visual understanding! 🎓 #QuantumEducation #STEM

@qiskit @Cirq @PennyLane Built with React + custom quantum simulator. Ready to extend with your frameworks! Would love contributions & feedback from the quantum community! 🤝 #OpenSource

@OsakaUniv 大阪大学 Excited to contribute to quantum education! Our demos make quantum computing accessible - perfect for your quantum courses & research outreach. Let's make quantum accessible! 🌏

🚀 Try the demos yourself! Each one: • Runs in 30-60 seconds • Has clear "wow" moments • Compares classical vs quantum • Zero math jargon. Perfect for demos or learning! ⚛️

💻 Built with React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS & custom quantum simulator. All demos are open source, deployable to Vercel/Netlify, ready for real quantum hardware integration. #WebDev #QuantumTech

🔮 Coming soon: • Quantum teleportation demo • Real hardware noise visualization • Quantum art/music generator. Plus: Integration with @IBMQuantum @GoogleQuantumAI APIs! Stay tuned! ⚛️

🙏 Thank you to the quantum computing community! @OsakaUniv @IBMQuantum @GoogleQuantumAI @AmazonBraket Your work inspires accessible quantum education. Let's make quantum computing understandable for everyone! 🌟 #QuantumCommunity
